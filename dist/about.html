              <h3>Helping people become better digital citizens</h3>
              <p>
                The goal of UniTracks is to help deal with the digital skills
                gaps within the UK. A 2019 study conducted by Lloyds Bank found
                that 11.9 million people do not have the essential digital
                skills needed for day-to-day life meaning they are unable to
                turn on a device or open an app. The study also found that 53%
                of employees do not have the digital skills needed for work.
                These figures highlight the importance of teaching digital
                citizenship and part of UniTracks aims is to help educate
                university students about core digital skills. This will help
                reduce the digitals skills gap and will prepare students for the
                digital workplace environments.

                Digital citizenship is about much more than online safety — or a
                long list of don’ts. It’s also about the do’s that help create
                thoughtful, empathetic digital citizens who can wrestle with the
                important ethical questions at the intersection of technology
                and humanity.
