							which could infect your PC with a virus, to websites which harvest your personal data, it is easy for
							hackers to advantage of you while using browser to access Internet resources. Browsers are such an
							integral part of the Internet and users must be careful while using them to ensure they protect themselves
							from potential online attacks.

						<h2 class="my-1">Browser security best practises</h2>
						<p class="section-text">
							Below is a list of best pracitises that will strengthen your browser security:
						</p>
						<ol class="track-list">
							<li>
								Keep your browser up-to-date - Always update the latest version of your browser as this apply patches to
								fix existing vulnerabilities in your browser
							</li>
							<li>
								Always use anti-virus software - While browsers do warn you about dangerous sites, it is always
								recommended to use some form of anti-virus software which can scan for and remove malicious files on
								your computer
							</li>
							<li>
								Use HTTPS - Have you ever noticed the little padlock next to the website name in the top URL bar? This
								means that the website uses HTTPS which is a secure way to transfer data between a web browser and a web
								server. The data is encryption between the browser and server, making it difficult for hackers to see
								what data is being transfered
							</li>
							<li>
								Block Pop-ups and scripts - Pop-ups are often used as forms of online advertising intended to attract
								web traffic. Pop-ups have been known to infect PCs with viruses such as spyware and trojan horses. For
								this reason, it is recommended to disable popups either through the browser settings or using an advert
								block extension such as AdBlock.
							</li>
